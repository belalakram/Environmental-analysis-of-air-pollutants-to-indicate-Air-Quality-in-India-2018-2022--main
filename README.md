# 🌏 Environmental Analysis of Air Pollutants to Indicate Air Quality in India (2018–2022)

![Header](images/header_summary.png)

## 📊 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of key air pollutants (SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10) across India from 2018 to 2022. The goal is to determine pollution trends, analyze AQI changes, and highlight excess pollutant levels based on WHO guidelines.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights

- PM10 and PM2.5 levels are **significantly higher** than WHO AQG standards.
- SO2 levels remain within safe limits throughout the years.
- Year-wise trends show some reduction in NO2 but increase in other pollutants post-2020.
- Correlation analyses reveal strong relationships between PM10 and PM2.5.
